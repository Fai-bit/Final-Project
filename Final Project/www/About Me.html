            <h1>About Me</h1><br><br>
            My name is Faisal Alkhammash, a 24 year old software engineer studying at Al Yamamah University.<br>
            For as long as I remember, I've always been a pet lover, especially cats. Recently, a friend of mine suggested to me the idea of adopting one from a shelter,
            to which I had doubts about at first; can I really take proper care for a pet? After some time I gave in.<br><br>
            This is Juno, a 2 year old moody persian cat. She's mostly playful, and hates getting her hair groomed or her nails cut.

            <h1>Skateboarding</h1><br><br>
            I was never really into outdoor activities. I would still go out with friends and visit relatives, but outdoor activities such as sightseeing or shopping were unfulfilling for me.
            <br><br>However, I always wondered about the physics of skateboards. On paper, it didn't make sense. How can a board just lift off the ground and do flips?
            Excited as I was curious, I tried skateboarding. Turns out, it was a very fun activity for me.
